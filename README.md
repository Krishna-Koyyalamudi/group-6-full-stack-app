### Implementation Style
#### 1.Parallel programming:
It is a type of computation in which large tasks can be divided into smaller tasks, which can then be implemented simultaneously.
#### 2.Pair Programming:
While implementing this project we have faced lot of heroku deployment issues due to continuously updating the MySql driver connection while developing in our local systems. So In order to fix this issue we have come up with an idea that we should maintain only one MySql connection, so  we established a connection to one of our team mate Krishna laptop and then we started pair programming. By doing this we have successfully developed the backend location mapping with the current device location. However in our project, pair programming played a vital role for collaborative teamwork and high quality software.
